```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Both commands should show a version number.

### Install Docker

1. Go to [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Download Docker Desktop for your system (Windows/Mac)

## 4. Migrate the Database

Migrations are used to create the actual database tables we'll use later in the code.

3. Then start again from step 3

## Creating new migrations

1. Navigate to the server folder:

```bash
cd server
